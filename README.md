I am a Developer from Lebanon, I recently graduated as an investigative journalist and my main goal is to fight and expose corruption! and maybe having my own PI firm, unfortunately my country is suffering, and I believe that each one has his roll to cure this cancer! I am passionate about learning especially OSINT tools and new technology. I can work well on my own initiative and as part of a team, focus in a position with full responsibility and honesty. My main strength is adaptability, and the determination to get the job done, develops a new experience. Learning something new from every experience because there is always room for self improvement both personally and professionally.
